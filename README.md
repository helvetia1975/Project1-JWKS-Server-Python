# Project1-JWKS-Server-Python
This set of files creates JWTS on HTTPS port 8080 using RSA key pairs. Public keys are served on a JWKS endpoint on the server, checking to make sure the keys are good i.e. not expired.

This is my second rendering of this project, this time in Python 3.11. This time around it was successful and was able to serve the request on the HTTP server and run the gradebot. There is no test suite present, unfortunately.
